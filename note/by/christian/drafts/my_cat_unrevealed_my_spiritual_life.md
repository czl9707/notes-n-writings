title: My Cat Unrevealed My Spiritual Status

There are many adjectives can be applied on our Cat, [Pickle](https://www.instagram.com/pickle__chen/). She is talkative, active, cute, warm, however she is not a cat with spontaneity to get close to us.

My wife long will Pickle to come and close her more often. Therefore, after feeding her one night, Pickle was falling asleep almost immediately, my wife said "Why Pickle only want her chicken can, but rarely come and close us?". Maybe because that was a Sunday, she used the " " instead something more casual. I realized the scenario my wife described is exactly our spiritual lives. How we viewing Pickle is likely our profile from God's perspective.

Prayers are often considered as one of main appearance of ones' spiritual life. However prayers can easily fall into two desired trends. One either keeps praying for one specific daily matter eagerly, hoping Lord can solve it, or focuses too much on pure spiritual life and disconnected with physical life. Either way, it is a disconnection from God.

Most of us started to pray for some specific matters before or after baptism. And while reading more scriptures and listening more preaching, the thought "I shouldn't only pray for bread and butter" become obvious. I cannot speak for others, but this pushed me to another extreme, prayers become a form while losing its connection to the God.

From my aspect, it is even worse than only praying for "". Pickle isn't __ us a lot, while still begs a lot for her meals, and we never blame her for her begging food. But what if she stop meowing for her favorite cans? I believe we no longer matter to her any more.

I am not saying only prayer for daily matters is good, but daily matter is something tied one's flesh and spirit, in which sense it help a living human connect back to Lord. A prayer pleasant Lord always uses Lord as its subject, while directly related to what is happening on the ground. 

> But Moses sought the favor of the Lord his God. “Lord,” he said, “why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’ ” Then the Lord relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
> -- Exodus 32:11-14 NIV

When we look at Moses's prayer on Mount Sinai, his pray for God's mercy on Israel, but tied all his words back to God's honor, God's promises. 

Some thought derived from our cats begging for her meal, Either only praying for "" or only prayer for spiritual life is not admirable by Lord. One action item for me, start pray for something more specific while keep praying for my spiritual life.
