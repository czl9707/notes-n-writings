> Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” They came out of the town and made their way toward him.
> -- John 4:28-30 NIV

The Samaritan woman came to the well for water, while Jesus was waiting for her there. She came with a water jar, but left without it, because she had found her Messiah.

That was an ordinary noon for the Samaritan woman, until she met Jesus. In the same way, the Holy Spirit often meets us when and where we least expect. That is a gift, because God is always near. Yet it can also be unsettling, because His presence strips away our masks, leaving us exposed before Him.

Jesus spoke into her life as though reading a storybook, not to judge, but to reveal himself as the Messiah. Then He embraced her with his promise, *"But whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst"*. The Samaritan woman left with water jar unintentionally. Like a child leave their old toy at the moment something better captures his attention, the man in front of her matters far greater than her daily routines. She began to testify to others about Him right away.

Some may argue that her response was simply the result of seeing Jesus face to face. Yet, Scripture usually unfolds the cause and the consequence as an inseparable unity. She believed because Jesus chose her, and Jesus chose her knowing she would believe. She was given one encounter with God, and she seized it without letting go.

I can’t help but ask myself:

- What are my response when I encountered the Holy Spirit unexpectedly?
- Have I ever left some parts of old me behind?
- Do I ignore God’s promptings because I assume there will always be next chance?

Too often, I ignored God's words, denied my sin, turned my back while pretending to agree. Seldomly, I was deeply moved, confessed in the front of God, and made commitments. However that rarely lasted. The water jar was either never fully set down, or I quickly picked it back.

People leave small things behind for something greater. The water jar in my hand infers my considering it's more important than the Lord. My prayer is that one day I will leave it behind for His goodness, fully embracing God’s love without turning back.
