There are fair amount of criticism towards 文士法利赛人的律法主义, which easily lead us to think, obeying the Law is more applausible in Old Testament era comparing us in New Testament era.

And there was a related question. *Why God gave Israel the Law instead of giving them the 福音 directly? Was providing the Law a mistake in its first place?* 

However, Jesus made this really clear:

> Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 
> -- Matthew 5:17-18 NIV

The law and its positions wouldn't be changed, in terms of the time scale of human being, forever. The Law provided in Old Testament era shares the same spirit as 福音.

Obeying the Law is still mandatory for human beings, 

The Law isn't meant for the Law itself, but meant for its eventual goal, achieving the God's profile. However, this doesn't mean that we can skip it and reach the goal.It is impossible to achieve God's profile without fully obey the Law.

Simplifying things is the nature of human being from a lot of aspects. It leads to millions of evolution and advancement in human civilization, but it also leads to treating the method itself as eventual goal. This is exactly what happened on Israel. When the Law itself replacing the God, Jesus came, with 福音 brought to human beings, to make it absolutely clear, the Law is not the heaven, but the way to the heaven, which everyone must obey.
