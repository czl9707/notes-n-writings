## Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning
Input to Output mappings.
#### Example - LLM - Large Language Model
One sentence is breaked into a set of data, each using the first certain words, to predict the next word should appear.
#### Why Generative AI raise recently?
- The amount of data we need.
- The amount of compute power we need to train a large model.
- The way we train model.
#### Acquiring data
- Manual labeling
- From observing behaviors (User, Machine or ...)
- Download from website / partnerships
#### Use and Mis-use data to train AI 
- Do wait for you have 'enough' data. Start early.
- Garbage in, garbage out
- Data problems
	- Incorrect labels
	- Missing values
## Terminologies
#### Machine Learning vs. Data Science
ML is a long running system. Deliverable of ML is a piece of software.
Data Science gaining insights from datasets. 
#### Deep Learning
(Artificial) Neural Network
Neural Network is a huge mathematical equation.
## What AI Can do?
Anything you can do with 1 second of thought, we can probably now or soon automate.
- Learning a "simple" concept.
- Lots of data available
