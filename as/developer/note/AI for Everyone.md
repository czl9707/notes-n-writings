# What is AI?
## Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning
Input to Output mappings.
#### Example - LLM - Large Language Model
One sentence is breaked into a set of data, each using the first certain words, to predict the next word should appear.
#### Why Generative AI raise recently?
- The amount of data we need.
- The amount of compute power we need to train a large model.
- The way we train model.
#### Acquiring data
- Manual labeling
- From observing behaviors (User, Machine or ...)
- Download from website / partnerships
#### Use and Mis-use data to train AI 
- Do wait for you have 'enough' data. Start early.
- Garbage in, garbage out
- Data problems
	- Incorrect labels
	- Missing values
## Terminologies
#### Machine Learning vs. Data Science
ML is a long running system. Deliverable of ML is a piece of software.
Data Science gaining insights from datasets. 
#### Deep Learning
(Artificial) Neural Network
Neural Network is a huge mathematical equation.
## What AI Can do?
Anything you can do with 1 second of thought, we can probably now or soon automate.
- Learning a "simple" concept.
- Lots of data available
## Deep Learning
Neural Network: A group of artificial neuron while each is doing simple calculation.

# Building an AI Project
## Machine Learning Project
1. Collect data
2. Train model
	- Iterate many times until good enough 
3. Deploy model
	-  Get more data, and maintain/update model
## Data Science Project
1. Collect data
2. Analyze data
	- Iterate to get good insights
3. Suggest hypothese/actions
	- Deploy changes
	- Re-analyze periodically.
## Pick a Project
### Brainstorming Framework
- Think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs.
- What are the main drivers of business value?
- What are the main pain point in your business?
#### Make Progress even without Dig Data
- Having more data almost never hurts.
- Data makes some businesses defensible
- With small datasets, you can still make progress.
## Work with AI Team
### Specify Your Acceptance Criteria
- 95% accuracy ?
- Training Dataset vs. Test Dataset
- Pitfall: Expecting 100% accuracy
	- Limitations of ML
	- Insufficient data
	- Mislabeled data
	- Ambiguous labels
## Example Roles of an AI Team
- Software Engineer
- Machine Learning Engineer - Training Model
- Machine Learning Researcher - Extend state of the art in ML
- Data Scientist - Examine data and provide insights
- Data Engineer - organize data and make sure data is saved in an easily accessible, secure and cost effective way.
- AI Product Manager
-  
- Job title are evolving
## AI Pitrfalls to Avoid
- Don't 
	- Expect AI to solve everything
	- Hire ML engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases
	- Expect AI project to work the first time
	- Expect traditional planning processes to apply without changes
	- Think you need superstar AI engineers before you can do anything

## Majon AI Techniques
- Unsupervised Learning
	- Given data (without any specific desired output labels), find somthing interesting about the data.
	- Clustering
- Transfer Learning
	- Learn Task A and use knowledge to help on task B.
- Reinforcement Learning
	- Let the model whatever they want to do, and upvote it when they do good and downvote when they do bad.
- GANs - Generative Adversarial Network
- Knowledge Graph
