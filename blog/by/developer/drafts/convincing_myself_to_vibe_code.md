For a long time, I held a firm line: **I would never give AI a task I didn't already know how to accomplish myself.** I viewed myself as the final gatekeeper of logic, the one who understood every gear and spring in the machine. If I didn't understand the "how," I couldn't own the "why."

I used AI assistants, certainly, but I used them as sophisticated autocomplete—never as the driver. I wasn't saying "no" to AI, but I was firmly saying "no" to **vibe coding**.

## The Vibe Hits the Door

"Vibe Coding" describes building applications through pure natural language intent rather than manual syntax. It entered my radar in late 2024, and to be honest, it felt like a buzzword for the lazy. That changed when I saw it in my own living room. My wife used **v0** to spin up a functional web app in under thirty minutes using a free tier.

It was far from perfect—the UI was a bit "off" and the logic was brittle in places. **But it worked.** I used to proudly claim I could wire up a functional basic application within a day. She had just bypassed the hours of boilerplate and "plumbing" I usually pride myself on, right in front of me.

## Where It Thrives and Dies

Before this, I found that AI seldom had enough intelligence to help me fix a nuanced bug or upgrade a specific package. Naturally, I thought:

> "If you aren't able to even fix a bug, how can you build an app for me?"

That mindset held me back for a long time. However, after seeing that "v0 moment," I realized I was misjudging the tool's purpose. AI is the undisputed king of the **kickstart**. It is terrifyingly good at generating boilerplates, wiring up initial stubs, and solving extremely well-defined, isolated problems.

But the "vibe" has a ceiling. It suffers in the **enterprise environment**. Once you introduce complex business logic, massive existing codebases, and legacy systems that have been patched for a decade, AI starts hallucinating. In a poorly designed system or a repo with 100k+ lines of code, AI suggestions often make zero sense. It can't "feel" the weight of ten years of technical debt.

## Why We Say No

If you ask me why I originally said no to vibe coding, the honest answer isn't just about AI's technical capabilities. It's about our identity.

### The Quality Trap

We see the "garbage" code these tools generate—the lack of patterns, the duplication, the messy file structures—and we recoil. As engineers, we were trained to control the details. Giving that up feels like a betrayal of our craft.

### The Fear of the Unknown

AI has the momentum to push things fast. It introduces solutions or libraries I haven’t used. If I don't understand every mechanism under the hood, I feel like I'm losing my edge. It’s a philosophical hurdle: _Is it necessary to understand every line?_ To me, the answer was always **yes**. An unknown piece of code inside my project felt like a landmine waiting to go off.

### The Ego Check

There is a genuine, uncomfortable sense of professional jealousy. It feels "unfair" that a non-technical person can bypass the years of struggle I went through to learn a framework just by paying $20 for a subscription. Dismissing vibe coding as "not real work" makes us feel better about our own investment.

## Is Code Quality Really a Problem?

I've come to realize that vibe-coded projects have a **destiny of death.** They are built for validation. If the idea fails, the code dies in the "404 river" silently. If the idea succeeds, it eventually gets rewritten by an engineer.

- **From an Engineer's Perspective:** I write throwaway bash scripts or Python scratchpads all the time. I don't care about their quality. If I can accept a messy script for a 10-minute task, why can't I accept a vibe-coded prototype for a 1-day validation?
- **From a Non-Technical User's Perspective:** Most vibe-coders will never look at the codebase. They just need to test an idea without hiring an expensive engineer. This is actually a win for us—it reduces the amount of "thrown away" engineering work we have to do.

## Defining Software Engineering

**Software Engineering is more than just kickstarting applications; the vast majority of the job is maintaining them.** Realizing this helped me regain my confidence. If AI handles the "start," the engineer’s value shifts toward **sustainability.** Engineering is about refactoring the "vibe" into a maintainable form. It’s about designing systems that can survive the second year, not just the first weekend.

## Drawing the Line

AI can be a magic trick or a productivity tool. The line is blurry, but drawing it clearly helps me increase my speed without losing my identity.

- **The Vibe Side:** Use AI for exploration, rapid prototyping, and verification. If a PM wants to "vibe" to verify an idea, let them. That code is for short-term usage only.
- **The Engineer Side:** Use AI to implement **stubs**, fix **scoped bugs**, **learn** new patterns, set up **boilerplate**, anything well-defined and beneficial to one as an engineer.

I’m still a conservative engineer. I still care about the details. But realize the difference between disposable toys and real engineering products. By allowing AI to handle the "vibe," I can save my energy for the real engineering, the parts where the details actually matter.
